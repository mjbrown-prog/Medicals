# Medicals
***This Analysis will be centered around Pivot table and Data Visualization***

We would be going through Data set of Medical Students which contains the following:

- Age,
- Weight,
- Height,
- BMI,
- Temperature
- Gender
- Heart rate
- Blood pressure
- Smoking
- Diabetes and
- Cholesterol

üöÄ  ********Data Cleaning********

![Medical Data Set](https://github.com/mjbrown-prog/Medicals/assets/64136357/2e9d2719-f3c4-477c-b384-15de2e6357f6)

The data above was cleaned by Highlighting the column, used find and select, input a figure that is closely related to the stipulated figures or data given with ctrl enter which filled up the blank cells. This was done across all columms.

___

From the Data set presented, i was able to create a pivot table displaying:

- The Average values of Male and Female under (Age, BMI, Temperature, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure and Cholesterol)
- The Average Height and weight for both Genders in 2 decimal places.
- The number of students acroos different blood groups.
- The number of students who smoke and thosw who don't.
- The number of Students who have diabetes and those who do not have.


# Pivot Table

 ![Pivot Table 1](https://github.com/mjbrown-prog/Medicals/assets/64136357/bc14f764-e623-4e0d-9faa-ab4a3caa2209)

‚Ü™Ô∏è This was gotten by adding adding the gender on the row feild and the other parameters on the Values. After which i clicked on the Value field setting to calculate Average Value.


![Pivot Table 2](https://github.com/mjbrown-prog/Medicals/assets/64136357/59c6b54f-af99-4b9b-b316-f3a28402b61a)

üéØ From the above, the Average Height and Weight of Both Male and FemaleS were calculated by adding the both Genders inside the row field and Height and weight on the value field, after which the Value field setting was clicked to calculate Average Value.

![Pivot Table 3](https://github.com/mjbrown-prog/Medicals/assets/64136357/7925d986-52d6-4795-b434-3da3e53eaed1)

ü•â From the table above, the number of students across different blood goups were gotten by adding blood type in the Row field then the Number of students in the Value field, After which the Value field setting was clicked to calculate Count Value.

![Pivot Table 4](https://github.com/mjbrown-prog/Medicals/assets/64136357/16ac677c-b363-4a12-87ca-bf66dbbf605f)

üîÑ From the table above, to determiine the number of students who smoke and who do not. Smoking was put in the Rows field and Number of Students was put in the value field, After which the Value field setting was clicked to calculate Count Value.

![Pivot Table 5](https://github.com/mjbrown-prog/Medicals/assets/64136357/94945149-ab28-4293-8aa3-5adf08408c01)

‚ÜóÔ∏è From the table above, to determiine the number of students who has diabetes and those who dont have. Daibetes was put in the Rows field and Number of Students was put in the value field, After which the Value field setting was clicked to calculate Count Value.

# Data Visualization

We were able to visualize the data using Pivot Chart

![Pivot Graph 2](https://github.com/mjbrown-prog/Medicals/assets/64136357/4090ff10-3511-4920-9a0d-82a6fcf812f9)

- From the Column Chart above, it shows that Males have more height than females, however Females weight more than Males.

- From the doughnut Chart above, the number of Student with the highest number of Blood group type is **AB** and the number of student with the lowest blood group type is **A**.

- From the Pie Chart above, Those who dont Smoke are Higher than those who Smoke.

- From the Pie Chart above, Those who dont have Diabetes are Higher than those who have.

# Conclusion

The Skill i was able to Demonstrate is Data Cleaning, how to Create a Pivot Table and Data Visualization.
I got to know how to visualize data better.
